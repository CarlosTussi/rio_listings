# Notebooks

- This folder contains all the notebooks created as a first step for the project.

- Should you would wish to run them, run first the _EDA-FE_  notebooks and then the  _Model_ notebook, making sure you have downloaded the dataset from Inside Airbnb [here](https://data.insideairbnb.com/brazil/rj/rio-de-janeiro/2024-06-27/data/listings.csv.gz).

- [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/products/navigator) recommended to run the notebooks.

1) **EDA-FE**: 
    * Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering
2) **Model**
    * Model selection and evaluation
3) **Sketch pipeline**
    * Sketch for the pipeline code implemented in the source folder.
4) **Sketch data preparation**
    * Initial sketch for EDA and FE.


> IMPORTANT

_OBS 1: The notebooks are not the official version. The official and upodated version is the code found in the source folder._ 

_OBS 2: The sketches are even less updated and may not reflect very well the project or some major decisions made regarding feature extraction, data cleaning, models, etc. They are kept for reference only._
