# Dataset


* Please download the dataset from Inside Airbnb website [here](https://data.insideairbnb.com/brazil/rj/rio-de-janeiro/2024-06-27/data/listings.csv.gz) (as they have requested the files to be downloaded directly from there) and place inside this folder.

* When running either the notebook files or the training python code from source folder, the transformed datasets will be placed on this folder and will be used for the model part of the code. Therefore, **do not delete this folder**.

> _**Important**: The dataset that conforms with this project since its last update is the file that has the name and extension **listings.csv.gz** from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil section [here](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/). Inside Airbnb periodically releases updates in the dataset and if you are testing the project with a newer version of the data, you need to make sure that the file has same naming and file extension as mentioned above._
